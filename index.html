                            I lay awake at 3am in the morning, thinking. April,
                            2015. We first met during orientation. You were
                            annoying, to say the least. Trying your best to fit in
                            with our classmates, you failed tremendously. I was
                            among your ‚Äúvictims‚Äù, caught up in your stories and
                            constant yammering. Yet, I enjoyed our little talks from
                            time to time, when everyone else was trying to ignore
                            you. We talked about you behind your back, complaints
                            all over the place. We came up with a nickname for you,
                            Elsa. Not that you would ever know. You gave me a lift
                            to the station whenever I asked you for one, but you
                            never asked for something in return. I could only give
                            you my time, since it was the only thing I had. <break>
                            Fast forward a few months, and I find myself surrounded by
                            lots of new people. Acquaintances, mostly. You‚Äôve made
                            new friends, like finally. We were distancing ourselves,
                            constantly changing. I miss talking to you, and I wonder
                            when was the last time I asked for a lift. One day, I
                            realise that my friends didn‚Äôt save a seat for me in the
                            lecture theatre. I find myself sitting down next to you,
                            and I notice you for the first time. I didn‚Äôt know I
                            would find myself admiring you, then and there. <break>
                            March, 2016. Our foundation is coming to an end, and I‚Äôm
                            thinking of asking you out. On the other hand, I enjoy
                            your company, yet I feel smothered by it. It is my fault
                            that I talk to other ladies too often, since I want you
                            to feel secure. We talk about our futures once again,
                            and I use a language course as my wingman. One day, in a
                            revision class, you ask me to help you write in to ask
                            about the details of the course. You gave me your phone,
                            and asked for mine. I blushed, obviously. That small
                            gesture was enough to tell me that you placed your trust
                            in me. Couple of weeks later, and I find myself sitting
                            beside you on the train, going to Goethe. My friends
                            there ask me if you‚Äôre my sister, but I brush them off.
                            I introduce you as my friend, not knowing the
                            consequences of my actions. <break>
                            May, 2016. You call me one day out of the blue, asking 
                            me where I am. I can hear that you‚Äôre probably very angry 
                            as I‚Äôm not at the language class like I promised. I found 
                            a job, and I loved it. I start wondering if we would 
                            converse in German when we see each other. The thought of 
                            that makes me smile. The sound of disappointment is in 
                            your voice, and I want to make it up to you. <break> 
                            September, 2016. I see you for the first time in months, 
                            and you look lovely. I make a mistake, talking to someone 
                            I should not be talking to, avoiding you for the most of 
                            it. I am distancing myself from you once again, being the 
                            coward that I am. February, 2017. I want to ask you out 
                            again, after knowing the truth. You politely push me aside,
                            but I am very stubborn. Push then comes to shove. Before I
                            know it, our relationship has soured. April, 2017. It is
                            nearing the end, but I will still go for our final
                            papers in May, just to see you one last time. I want to
                            tell you how much I appreciate your support, thank you
                            for all that you‚Äôve done for me, and for putting your
                            faith in someone broken like me. <break> 
                            Gute Nacht.
